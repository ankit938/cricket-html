        <p> Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement;
             others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball 
             games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.In cricket's case, a key difference is

            It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime 
            during the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being
             played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). 
             The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that</p>
